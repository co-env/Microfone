Remover o jumper no pino 34 (ADC1_CH6) ao gravar

Funcionality
----
- ADC1 (8 channels, attached to GPIOs 32 - 39)
- ADC2 used within wi-fi module

unit work modes
- ADC-RTC 
- ADC-DMA mode

### ADC-RTC 

configured before reading
- ` adc1_config_width()` precision 
    > max resolution 12bits)
- `adc1_config_channel_atten()` attenuation

    > **attenuation**: This is a voltage scaling factor. By default, the allowable input range is 0-1V but with different attenuations we can scale the input voltage into this range. The available scales beyond the 0-1V 
    > *include 0-1.34V, 0-2V and 0-3.6V*.

  (tipo avr/arduino)

- `adc1_get_raw()` conversion result

- `adc_vref_to_gpio()` used to route internal reference voltage to a GPIO pin
  > calibrate ADC reading 

### Minimizing Noise 

Higher precision approach. 

> connect a 0.1uF capacitor to the ADC input pad in use

#### Calibration

> The `esp_adc_cal/include/esp_adc_cal.h` API provides functions to correct for differences in measured voltages caused by variation of ADC reference voltages (Vref) between chips

> characterizing one of the ADCs at a given attenuation to obtain a characteristics curve (ADC-Voltage curve) that takes into account the difference in ADC reference voltage. The characteristics curve is in the form of `y = coeff_a * x + coeff_b` and is used to convert ADC readings to voltages in mV
> 
> calibrations values stored in eFuse or provided by the user

Three sources of calibration values
- **Two Point** values represent each of the ADCsâ€™ readings at 150 mV and 850 mV. To obtain more accurate calibration results these values should be measured by user and burned into eFuse BLOCK3.

- **eFuse Vref** represents the true ADC reference voltage. This value is measured and burned into eFuse BLOCK0 during factory calibration.

- **Default Vref** is an estimate of the ADC reference voltage provided by the user as a parameter during characterization. If Two Point or eFuse Vref values are unavailable, Default Vref will be used.
